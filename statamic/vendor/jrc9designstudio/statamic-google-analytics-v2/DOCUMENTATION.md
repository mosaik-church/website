## Reporting Setup
To use the reporting features of the Google Analytics Addon you will have to create an account with Google, sign in and set it up with credentials to use Google's APIs.

### Create A Project & Credentials
1. Go to [Google APIâ€™s site](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) and select `Select a project`, and make a new project, or make sure the correct project is selected from the header.

2. Enable the Google Analytics API by navigating to `Libary` in the left-hand side navigation. Search for `Google Analytics API`, select this Libary to view the description and enable it. (Don't confuses this with the `Google Analytics Reporting API`)

3. Create Credentials by clicking on the `Create Credentials` button in the notification (on the top right) or by going to the `Credentials` item in the left-hand side navigation.

4. Select `Google Analytics API` from the dropdown for what API are you using?

5. Select `Web Server ...` for where will you be calling the API from.

6. Select `Application Data ...` for what data will you be accessing.

7. Select `No, I'm not using them` for Are you using Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine? (unless you are)

8. Click the button `What credentials do I need?`

9. Enter a service account name (`statamic` for example)

10. Select `Service Account > Service Account User` for the role

11. Select `JSON` as the Key type

12. Click `continue`, save the key file to a safe location, we will be using it later (and keep it private).

### Granting Permission to your Google Analytics Property
1. Go to the [Google Analytics Website](https://analytics.google.com/analytics) and navigate to the settings for the appropriate property.

2. Select `User Management` under the view column.

3. Add a new user with `Read & Analyze` access using the `client_email` value from the JSON file you downloaded.

4. Get the `View ID` by clicking on `View Settings` on the Google Analytics website.

### Setting it all up
1. Add the `View ID` to the Google Analytics Settings under the `Reporting Configuration` section in the Statamic Control panel.

2. Upload the JSON file & rename it to `site/settings/addons/google-analytics-credentials.json` or some other location outside of your version control system. Just make sure to set the path in the configuration (including the file name) if you put the file in a different location.

## Widgets
There are a number of widgets you can add to the Statamic Dashboard to quickly view reports, in addition to the Google Analytics report pages in the navigation.

The pipe `|` below indicates options, only one of the options should be used.

## Page / Entity Stats
To see page view stats on pages and entities add the Google Analytics field to your fieldset.

## Page Hits (Tag)
If you want to show how many hits a page has, you can use the page hits tag: `{{ google_analytics:hits }}`

## Page Hits Sorting (Filter)
If you want to sort your collection entities by page hits you can do so using the custom sort filter and setting the default sort to none. `{{ collection:blog filter="google_analytics" sort="false" }}`

## Page Hits Precache
If you are sorting or filtering content by page hits you may want to pre cache your page hits numbers in the background. You can do this using the `php please googleanalytics:precache-hits` command.

In order for this to be effective you should set up a cron job to run this command before your cache expires.

You can set the cache time for page hits on the settings page for Google Analytics.

## Access Restrictions
By default, anybody with *CP Access* will be able to see Google Analytics reports.

If you want to restrict what users can see the Google Analytics reports you can the slugs of the roles you wish to grant access to on the settings page under `Roles with Access`.

Example:
```
roles_with_access:
  - admin
  - blog-editor
  - editor
```

## Add Blockers
- uBlock Origin, and possibly other addons of this type can cause the scripts this addon use to not load. If you disable the plugin for your domain the scripts should load, and the addon should work.
